# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-08)

**Core value:** Students instantly know which fresh internships are worth their time and exactly how to prove they fit - requirement by requirement - so they apply to fewer roles with higher confidence and better-tailored evidence.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation Setup

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation Setup)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-08 — Roadmap created with 6 phases covering 22 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Proof-first positioning: Lead with requirement-level evidence mapping, not discovery volume (differentiates from LinkedIn)
- Internship-only V1: Tight ICP focus, defer full-time roles to avoid early dilution
- Trust over automation: Show source excerpts, confidence scores, manual overrides - never hallucinate fit
- Supported sources only: Be explicit about coverage, build trust through honesty
- Personal proof graph as moat: Reusable evidence compounds on user-specific data

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 1:** Need to validate Docling integration (newer tool with limited production case studies) during planning. Fallback: pdf-parse for basic extraction, manual entry for complex cases.

**Phase 3:** Embedding dimension optimization needed - pgvector supports up to 2000 dimensions efficiently but OpenAI text-embedding-3-large produces 3072. May need dimension reduction or different embedding model.

**Phase 4:** Job board API access validation needed - Indeed and LinkedIn have strict requirements. May need to start with smaller boards or user-submitted URLs in V1.

**Phase 5:** Confidence threshold calibration (85%+ for auto-accept, 70-85% for review, <70% quarantine) needs validation with real data. Plan A/B testing during Phase 5.
